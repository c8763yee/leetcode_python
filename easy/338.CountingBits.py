# Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i
# (0 <= i <= n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of
# i.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 2
# Output: [0,1,1]
# Explanation:
# 0 --> 0
# 1 --> 1
# 2 --> 10
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 5
# Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
# Explanation:
# 0 --> 0
# 1 --> 1
# 2 --> 10
# 3 --> 11
# 4 --> 100
# 5 --> 101
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 0 <= n <= 10^5
#
#
#
# Follow up:
#
#
# It is very easy to come up with a solution with a runtime of O(n log n). Can
# you do it in linear time O(n) and possibly in a single pass?
# Can you do it without using any built-in function (i.e., like
# __builtin_popcount in C++)?

        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if sub * 2 == i:
                sub = i

            memory[i] = memory[i - sub] + 1
